In JavaScript, almost everything is an object. An object can be defined as an unordered collection of data in the form of "Key:value" pairs.
The key here can also be called as a property of an object. The properties of an object together give us an idea about the object we are dealing with.

eg:

Student={
name:"Ravi",
age:21,
dept:"CSE"
fav_icecream:"Choco-vanilla"
};

The above is an object Student and name,age,dept,fav_icecreams are the properties of the object. 

print each value individually:

console.log(Student.name) //Ravi
console.log(Student.age)  //21
console.log(Student.dept) //CSE
console.log(Student.fav_icecream)// Choco-vanilla

An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables donâ€™t actually store the value.


Each property of an object is also a variable, except that it is encapsulated within the object.
