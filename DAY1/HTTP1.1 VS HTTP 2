Q) Write a blog on difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the method which clients and servers use to send requests/responses to each other.

HTTP 1.1:
Was developed in the Year 1997.However there were some problems which were encountered.
i) HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other. So if one resource can't be loaded, it blocks all other resources from being loaded.
ii) Repetition of header data:Every HTTP request is independent of the previous and the next request. Each HTTP request will be packed with header data(which cannot be compressed).
    Thus the same header data will be sent as part of every request, which is not required.
iii) Even though HTTP 1.1 currently supports upto 6 seperate TCP connections to be made in parallel, it is not enough.
    
    
    
HTTP 2:
i)Uses a single secure TCP connection.
ii)Every HTTP request is sent as a stream, thus no one resource will block the other resource. HTTP 2 does this by splitting data into binary-coded messages and numbering these messages,
  so that client knows to which stream each binary message belongs to.
  
iii) HPACK is a feature in HTTP 2 which seperates header data from request data and can be zipped.
iv) Push frames is another feature which enables servers to send mandatory resources in andvance along with the HTTP response.
