			<p style="color:white">I am sure that lot of us cook like it is an experiment(myself included). Well the last 18 months
									have taught me the importance of mastering the art of cooking, for it is a very important skill and
									will come handy, if you ever have to travel to some other place and be alone. You need not know how to	
									cook something extravagant, however knowing how to prepare simple items which you consume on a daily basis
									can prove to be extremely valuable. You also need not depend on someone else to satisfy your appetite.I have realised
									the importance of being independent and thus in the last 18 months I have learnt to make quite a lot of dishes, with
									more success than I had ever expected. It gives you immense satisfaction when someone appreciates something which you have done
									with a lot of effort.</p>
				
				
			<p style="color:white">Thus I have developed this website in which I would love to share the steps to prepare food items which 
									will prove to be very useful.</p>
